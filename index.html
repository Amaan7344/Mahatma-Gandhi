  <h2>Death</h2>
  <p>Mahatma Gandhi was tragically assassinated on January 30, 1948, in New Delhi, at the age of 78. He was on his way to attend an evening prayer meeting at Birla House when he was shot at point-blank range by Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist who opposed Gandhi‚Äôs efforts to promote peace and unity between Hindus and Muslims after Partition. Gandhi‚Äôs last words were reportedly ‚ÄúHey Ram‚Äù as he collapsed. His death shocked the entire nation and the world, bringing an end to the life of a man who had become a global symbol of peace, truth, and non-violence. Millions mourned his passing, and he was cremated on the banks of the Yamuna River. His legacy continues to inspire civil rights movements and peaceful resistance efforts around the world.</p>
